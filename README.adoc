= Languages
Benno Bielmeier
:source-language: ruby

Provides all known human languages defined in ISO 639-3.
This includes all individual languages already accounted for in ISO 639-2 as well as extinct, ancient, constructed, and historical languages.

The link:data/[data] is taken from the ISO 639-3 registration authority (ISO 639-3/RA) https://iso639-3.sil.org/[SIL International].

== Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:
[source]
----
gem 'languages'
----

And then execute:
....
$ bundle install
....

Or install it yourself as:
....
$ gem install languages
....

== Usage

After loading the gem with `require 'languages'` one can retrieve certain languages as following:
[source]
----
# Retrieve a language by its ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3 code, or by its reference name (english)
german = Languages[:de]
english = Languages['eng']     # Symbol or String does not matter => no pre conversion required
klingon = Languages['KLINgon'] # So does the casing => do not worry about it

# Get all languages
Languages.all

# Search by name
Languages.search "^Germ"
Languages.search /\AJapan/

# Since ISO 639-3 categorizes the languages by scope and type, one can filter by them
# By scope
Languages.ancient
Languages.constructed
Languages.extinct
Languages.historical
Languages.living
Languages.special

# By languages types
Languages.individual_languages
Languages.macrolanguages
Languages.special_languages
----

Custom language selections can be done accessing `Languages.all`:
[source]
----
Languages.all.select { |l| %w[ancient historical].include?(l.type) }
----

The `Language` objects have a simple read-only interface:
[source]
----
language = Language[:tlh]
language.name                 # => Klingon
language.alpha2               # => nil
language.alpha3               # => :tlh
language.alpha3_bibliographic # => :tlh
language.alpha3_terminology   # => :tlh
language.type                 # => "constructed"
language.scope                # => "individual"

language.extinct?             # => false
language.constructed?         # => true
language.individual_language? # => true
----
